# README

A responsively-designed minimal blogging platform using [UIKit](https://getuikit.com/).

## Adding posts

Post files should be put into assets/content as .html files. If posts are written in Markdown then you can paste Pandoc output directly into the file (see examples). File extension can be changed in inc/config.php.

## Content folders

Currently the platform supports one layer of folders being created in assets/content.
